# Jolene

A modern C++ library for enhanced enum functionality, providing seamless conversion between enum values and their string representations.

## Features

- Compile-time conversion between enum values and strings
- Iteration over enum values, string values and `EnumString` pairs
- Compile-time validity checking for enum values
- Header-only implementation for easy integration

This library aims to simplify working with enums in C++, reducing boilerplate code and enhancing type safety. It's designed to be efficient, flexible, and easy to use in C++ projects.

Still under development, any contribution is appreciated.
